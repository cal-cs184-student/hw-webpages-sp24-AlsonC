		 In my own words, rasterizing triangles is the process of converting from an .svg file to pixels, by sampling the .svg at certain points to determine whether how pixels should be colored.

		 <br>
		 <br>
		 To rasterize triangles, we implemented the rasterize_triangle function. To do this and to avoid overcomputation,
		 I first found min and max of x and y, for each triangle to create a rectangle 'bounds.' From there, I looped through 
		 every pixel within the rectangle bounds and called a helper function, inside triangle.

		<br>
		<br>
		This function inside triangle takes in three points (the points of the triangle as defined) and also another point that we want to test
		whether it is inside the triangle or not. Within the body of the triangle, we calculate l0, l1, and l2 by first finding dx and dy between each pairing of x and y.
		Then we plugin the x and y we want to test for into the line equation. For example, to test whether (x,y) is either inside or outside line defined from point0 to point1,
		we set l0 to -(x - x0) * dy0 + (y - y0) * dx0. Then, once getting l0, l1, and l2, we test whether either all of them are greater or equal to 0, or whether all of them are less than
		or equal to 0. Therefore, to do this I looped through every x and y pairing that could potentially be in a triangle, then added 0.5 to test whether it was inside the triangle.

		<br>
		<br>
		If it was inside the triangle, I called fill_pixel() helper function to fill in the triangle. Because we only check the bounding box defined by max x and max y of the points of the triangle, it can be no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.

		For supersampling, I did everything the same as Task 1, except I changed two things. 
		<br><br>
		1. Instead of simply calling fill_pixel, I used sample_buffer, where I would keep track of the percentage fill each pixel should have.
		<br>
		2. Once within the bounding box, I created an extra double for loop. Within these for loops, I looped through the sqrt of the sample rate, as for each axis thats how many unique values lied on the axis. Ie. with a 
		sampling rate of 4, x has 2 unique values and y has 2 unique values. Then, I defined double u and double v so that they checked every possible pairing of root sample rate axis values. Then, I once again ran inside triangle, 
		if it is, I would increment the sample_buffer correpsponding to the pixel we were in by 1/sample rate. For example, if all supersamples fell inside the triangle, the sample buffer for that pixel would be 1.

		<br>
		The reason why tehse results are observed, when comparaing rate 1 (far left) and rate 16 (far right) is because with supersampling, we have the ability to represent a pixel as 'half' colored, even 
		if the original reference point doesn't lie within the triangle. Especially at corners, where only a small bit of a pixel lies within a triangle, supersampling gives us an opportunity to still show edges without having to increase our picture resolution.
